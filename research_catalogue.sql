(1, 'The purpose of the present experiment was to investigate whether, withvision, the magnitude of the effect of calf muscles fatigue on postural controlduring bipedal quiet standing depends on the eye-visual target distance. Twelveyoung university students were asked to stand upright as immobile as possiblein three visual conditions (No vision, Vision 1m and Vision 4m) executed in twoconditions of No fatigue and Fatigue of the calf muscles. Centre of footpressure displacements were recorded using a force platform. Similar increasedvariances of the centre of foot pressure displacements were observed in thefatigue relative to the No fatigue condition for both the No vision and Vision4m conditions. Interestingly, in the vision 1m condition, fatigue yielded: (1)a similar increased variance of the centre of foot pressure displacements tothose observed in the No vision and Vision 4m conditions along themedio-lateral axis and (2) a weaker destabilising effect relative to the Novision and Vision 4m conditions along the antero-posterior axis. These resultsevidence that the ability to use visual information for postural control duringbipedal quiet standing following calf muscles fatigue is dependent on theeye-visual target distance.

(2, 'Animal vision spans a great range of complexity, with systems evolving todetect variations in optical intensity, distribution, colour, and polarisation.Polarisation vision systems studied to date detect one to four channels oflinear polarisation, combining them in opponent pairs to provideintensity-independent operation. Circular polarisation vision has never beenseen, and is widely believed to play no part in animal vision. Polarisation isfully measured via Stokes parameters--obtained by combined linear and circularpolarisation measurements. Optimal polarisation vision is the ability to seeStokes parameters: here we show that the crustacean emph{Gonodactylussmithii} measures the exact components required. This vision provides optimalcontrast-enhancement, and precise determination of polarisation with noconfusion-states or neutral-points--significant advantages. We emphasise thatlinear and circular polarisation vision are not different modalities--both arenecessary for optimal polarisation vision, regardless of the presence ofstrongly linear or circularly polarised features in the animals environment.'),

In this survey, we describe the types ofannotations computer vision researchers have collected using crowdsourcing, andhow they have ensured that this data is of high quality while annotation effortis minimized. We begin by discussing data collection on both classic (e.g.,object recognition) and recent (e.g., visual story-telling) vision tasks. Wethen summarize key design decisions for creating effective data collectioninterfaces and workflows, and present strategies for intelligently selectingthe most important data instances to annotate.

(5, 'Computer vision is hard because of a large variability in lighting, shape,and texture; in addition the image signal is non-additive due to occlusion.Generative models promised to account for this variability by accuratelymodelling the image formation process as a function of latent variables withprior beliefs. Bayesian posterior inference could then, in principle, explainthe observation. While intuitively appealing, generative models for computervision have largely failed to deliver on that promise due to the difficulty ofposterior inference. As a result the community has favoured efficientdiscriminative approaches. We still believe in the usefulness of generativemodels in computer vision, but argue that we need to leverage existingdiscriminative or even heuristic computer vision methods. We implement thisidea in a principled way with an informed sampler and in careful experimentsdemonstrate it on challenging generative models which contain renderer programsas their components. We concentrate on the problem of inverting an existinggraphics rendering engine, an approach that can be understood as InverseGraphics. The informed sampler, using simple discriminative proposals based onexisting computer vision technology, achieves significant improvements ofinference.'),

(8, 'The representation of images in the brain is known to be sparse. That is, asneural activity is recorded in a visual area ---for instance the primary visualcortex of primates--- only a few neurons are active at a given time withrespect to the whole population. It is believed that such a property reflectsthe efficient match of the representation with the statistics of naturalscenes. Applying such a paradigm to computer vision therefore seems a promisingapproach towards more biomimetic algorithms. Herein, we will describe abiologically-inspired approach to this problem. First, we will describe anunsupervised learning paradigm which is particularly adapted to the efficientcoding of image patches. Then, we will outline a complete multi-scale framework---SparseLets--- implementing a biologically inspired sparse representation ofnatural images. Finally, we will propose novel methods for integrating priorinformation into these algorithms and provide some preliminary experimentalresults. We will conclude by giving some perspective on applying suchalgorithms to computer vision. More specifically, we will propose thatbio-inspired approaches may be applied to computer vision using predictivecoding schemes, sparse models being one simple and efficient instance of suchschemes.'),
(9, 'Traditional architectures for solving computer vision problems and the degreeof success they enjoyed have been heavily reliant on hand-crafted features.However, of late, deep learning techniques have offered a compellingalternative -- that of automatically learning problem-specific features. Withthis new paradigm, every problem in computer vision is now being re-examinedfrom a deep learning perspective. Therefore, it has become important tounderstand what kind of deep networks are suitable for a given problem.Although general surveys of this fast-moving paradigm (i.e. deep-networks)exist, a survey specific to computer vision is missing. We specificallyconsider one form of deep networks widely used in computer vision -convolutional neural networks (CNNs).

We hope that our recipe-style survey will serve as a guide,particularly for novice practitioners intending to use deep-learning techniquesfor computer vision.'),

This is anill-posed problem that requires regularization. We propose an objectivefunction combining detection likelihoods with a prior minimizing curvature ofthe center-lines or surfaces. Unlike simple block-coordinate descent, wedevelop a novel algorithm that is able to perform joint optimization oflocation and detection variables more effectively. Our lower bound optimizationalgorithm applies to quadratic or absolute curvature. The proposed early visionframework is sufficiently general and it can be used in many higher-levelapplications.

Centre offoot pressure (CoP) displacements were recorded using a force platform. Resultsshowed that (1) the cervical muscular fatigue yielded increased CoPdisplacements in the absence of vision, (2) this effect was more accentuatedwhen somatosensation was degraded by standing on a foam surface and (3) theavailability of vision allowed the individuals to suppress this destabilisingeffect.

This problem can be tackled by using computer visionsystem in robot. This paper proposes a computer vision based method foranalyzing visual data acquired from camera for perceiving the overlap of wires,ropes, hoses i.e. detecting tangles. Information obtained after processingimage according to the proposed method comprises of position of tangles intangled object and which wire passes over which wire. This information can thenbe used to guide robot to untangle wire/s. Given an image, preprocessing isdone to remove noise. Then edges of wire are detected. After that, the image isdivided into smaller blocks and each block is checked for wire overlap/s andfinding other relevant information. TANGLED-100 dataset was introduced, whichconsists of images of tangled linear deformable objects. Method discussed inhere was tested on the TANGLED-100 dataset.

(14, 'The SP theory of intelligence aims to simplify and integrate concepts incomputing and cognition, with information compression as a unifying theme. Thisarticle discusses how it may be applied to the understanding of natural visionand the development of computer vision. The theory, which is described quitefully elsewhere, is described here in outline but with enough detail to ensurethat the rest of the article makes sense.  Low level perceptual features such as edges or corners may be identified bythe extraction of redundancy in uniform areas in a manner that is comparablewith the run-length encoding technique for information compression.  The concept of multiple alignment in the SP theory may be applied to therecognition of objects, and to scene analysis, with a hierarchy of parts andsub-parts, and at multiple levels of abstraction.  The theory has potential for the unsupervised learning of visual objects andclasses of objects, and suggests how coherent concepts may be derived fromfragments.  As in natural vision, both recognition and learning in the SP system isrobust in the face of errors of omission, commission and substitution.  The theory suggests how, via vision, we may piece together a knowledge of thethree-dimensional structure of objects and of our environment, it provides anaccount of how we may see things that are not objectively present in an image,and how we recognise something despite variations in the size of its retinalimage. And it has things to say about the phenomena of lightness constancy andcolour constancy, the role of context in recognition, and ambiguities in visualperception.  A strength of the SP theory is that it provides for the integration of visionwith other sensory modalities and with other aspects of intelligence.'),

While the generalproblem, modeling data by mixtures of manifolds, is very challenging, severalapproaches exist for modeling data by mixtures of affine subspaces (which isoften referred to as hybrid linear modeling). We translate some importantinstances of multi-manifold modeling to hybrid linear modeling in embeddedspaces, without explicitly performing the embedding but applying the kerneltrick. The resulting algorithm, Kernel Spectral Curvature Clustering, useskernels at two levels - both as an implicit embedding method to linearizenonflat manifolds and as a principled method to convert a multiway affinityproblem into a spectral clustering one.

This paper considers theinherent uncertainty of undoing the effects of tone-mapping. We observe thatthis uncertainty varies substantially across color space, making some pixelsmore reliable than others. We introduce a model for this uncertainty and amethod for fitting it to a given camera or imaging pipeline. Once fit, themodel provides for each pixel in a tone-mapped digital photograph a probabilitydistribution over linear scene colors that could have induced it. Wedemonstrate how these distributions can be useful for visual inference byincorporating them into estimation algorithms for a representative set ofvision tasks.'),

This is why we thought of using theidea of the Internet of Things to add a way of automating the use of IPcameras. In our case, we propose the analysis of pictures through ComputerVision to detect people in the analysed pictures. With this analysis, we areable to obtain if these pictures contain people and handle the pictures as ifthey were sensors with two possible states. Notwithstanding, Computer Vision isa very complicated field. This is why we needed a second hypothesis: Could wework with Computer Vision in the Internet of Things with a good accuracy toautomate or semi-automate this kind of events? The demonstration of thesehypotheses required a testing over our Computer Vision module to check thepossibilities that we have to use this module in a possible real environmentwith a good accuracy. Our proposal, as a possible solution, is the analysis ofentire sequence instead of isolated pictures for using pictures as sensors inthe Internet of Things.'),

Humans are notoriously good at it, even if some variationsare presumably more difficult to handle than others (e.g. 3D rotations). Humansare thought to solve the problem through hierarchical processing along theventral stream, which progressively extracts more and more invariant visualfeatures. This feed-forward architecture has inspired a new generation ofbio-inspired computer vision systems called deep convolutional neural networks(DCNN), which are currently the best algorithms for object recognition innatural images. Here, for the first time, we systematically compared humanfeed-forward vision and DCNNs at view-invariant object recognition using thesame images and controlling for both the kinds of transformation as well astheir magnitude. We used four object categories and images were rendered from3D computer models. In total, 89 human subjects participated in 10 experimentsin which they had to discriminate between two or four categories after rapidpresentation with backward masking. We also tested two recent DCNNs on the sametasks. We found that humans and DCNNs largely agreed on the relativedifficulties of each kind of variation: rotation in depth is by far the hardesttransformation to handle, followed by scale, then rotation in plane, andfinally position. This suggests that humans recognize objects mainly through 2Dtemplate matching, rather than by constructing 3D object models, and that DCNNsare not too unreasonable models of human feed-forward vision. Also, our resultsshow that the variation levels in rotation in depth and scale strongly modulateboth humans and DCNNs recognition performances.

We propose to discover shades of attribute meaning. Given anattribute name, we use crowdsourced image labels to discover the latent factorsunderlying how different annotators perceive the named concept. We show thatstructure in those latent factors helps reveal shades, that is, interpretationsfor the attribute shared by some group of annotators. Using these shades, wetrain classifiers to capture the primary (often subtle) variants of theattribute. The resulting models are both semantic and visually precise. Bycatering to users interpretations, they improve attribute prediction accuracyon novel images.

General image curves provide a complementary featurewhen keypoints are scarce, and result in 3D curve geometry, but face challengesnot addressed by the usual projective geometry of points and algebraic curves.We address these challenges by laying the theoretical foundations of aframework based on the differential geometry of general curves, includingstationary curves, occluding contours, and non-rigid curves, aiming at stereocorrespondence, camera estimation (including calibration, pose, and multiviewepipolar geometry), and 3D reconstruction given measured image curves. Bygathering previous results into a cohesive theory, novel results were madepossible, yielding three contributions. First we derive the differentialgeometry of an image curve (tangent, curvature, curvature derivative) from thatof the underlying space curve (tangent, curvature, curvature derivative,torsion). Second, we derive the differential geometry of a space curve fromthat of two corresponding image curves. Third, the differential motion of animage curve is derived from camera motion and the differential geometry andmotion of the space curve. The availability of such a theory enables novelcurve-based multiview reconstruction and camera estimation systems to augmentexisting point-based approaches. This theory has been used to reconstruct a 3Dcurve sketch, to determine camera pose from local curve geometry, andtracking; other developments are underway.'),

Previous work tackles this problem by eithersolving an optimization task given 2D keypoint positions, or training onsynthetic data with ground truth 3D information. In this work, we propose 3DINterpreter Network (3D-INN), an end-to-end framework which sequentiallyestimates 2D keypoint heatmaps and 3D object structure, trained on both real2D-annotated images and synthetic 3D data. This is made possible mainly by twotechnical innovations. First, we propose a Projection Layer, which projectsestimated 3D structure to 2D space, so that 3D-INN can be trained to predict 3Dstructural parameters supervised by 2D annotations on real images. Second,heatmaps of keypoints serve as an intermediate representation connecting realand synthetic data, enabling 3D-INN to benefit from the variation and abundanceof synthetic 3D objects, without suffering from the difference between thestatistics of real and synthesized images due to imperfect rendering. Thenetwork achieves state-of-the-art performance on both 2D keypoint estimationand 3D structure recovery.

These methods utilize a periodicassumption of the training samples to efficiently learn a classifier on allpatches in the target neighborhood. However, the periodic assumption alsointroduces unwanted boundary effects, which severely degrade the quality of thetracking model.  We propose Spatially Regularized Discriminative Correlation Filters (SRDCF)for tracking.

However, one major drawback of offline techniquesis that a complete set of training data has to be collected beforehand. Inaddition, once learned, an offline detector can not make use of newly arrivingdata. To alleviate these drawbacks, online learning has been adopted with thefollowing objectives: (1) the technique should be computationally and storageefficient; (2) the updated classifier must maintain its high classificationaccuracy. In this paper, we propose an effective and efficient framework forlearning an adaptive online greedy sparse linear discriminant analysis (GSLDA)model. Unlike many existing online boosting detectors, which usually applyexponential or logistic loss, our online algorithm makes use of LDAs learningcriterion that not only aims to maximize the class-separation criterion butalso incorporates the asymmetrical property of training data distributions.

Oncea rare galaxy is identified, studying it more effectively requires a set ofgalaxies of similar morphology, allowing generalization and statisticalanalysis that cannot be done when $N=1$. Databases generated by digital skysurveys can contain a very large number of galaxy images, and therefore once arare galaxy of interest is identified it is possible that more instances of thesame morphology are also present in the database. However, when a researcheridentifies a certain galaxy of rare morphology in the database, it is virtuallyimpossible to mine the database manually in the search for galaxies of similarmorphology. Here we propose a computer method that can automatically searchdatabases of galaxy images and identify galaxies that are morphologicallysimilar to a certain user-defined query galaxy. That is, the researcherprovides an image of a galaxy of interest, and the pattern recognition systemautomatically returns a list of galaxies that are visually similar to thetarget galaxy. The algorithm uses a comprehensive set of descriptors, allowingit to support different types of galaxies, and it is not limited to a finiteset of known morphology.

For extracting meaningful knowledge fromgeographical data, the relationships between spatial data objects need to beanalyzed. An important class of such relationships are topological relationslike the connectedness or overlap between regions. While real-worldgeographical regions such as lakes or forests do not have exact boundaries andare fuzzy, most of the existing analysis methods neglect this inherent featureof topological relations. In this paper, we propose a method for handling thetopological relations in spatial databases based on fuzzy region connectioncalculus (RCC). The proposed method is implemented in PostGIS spatial databaseand evaluated in analyzing the relationship of diseases as an importantapplication domain.

Thistechnique involves the indexing of the database models based on the sign of theprojections (PCA coefficients) of the first few relevant orders of principalcomponents of the four Stokes parameters. In this way, each model in thedatabase can be attributed a distinctive binary number of $2^{4n}$ bits, where$n$ is the number of PCA orders used for the indexing. Each of these binarynumbers (indexes) identifies a group of compatible models for the inversionof a given set of observed Stokes profiles sharing the same index. The completeset of the binary numbers so constructed evidently determines a partition ofthe database. The search of the database for the PCA inversion ofspectro-polarimetric data can profit greatly from this indexing. In practicalcases it becomes possible to approach the ideal acceleration factor of $2^{4n}$as compared to the systematic search of a non-indexed database for atraditional PCA inversion. This indexing method relies on the existence of aphysical meaning in the sign of the PCA coefficients of a model. For thisreason, the presence of model ambiguities and of spectro-polarimetric noise inthe observations limits in practice the number $n$ of relevant PCA orders thatcan be used for the indexing.'),

In Layer III, unlicensed users determine whether they should buy theexclusive usage right of licensed channels from the licensee, or theinformation regarding unlicensed channels from the database.

Exploitingand refining this knowledge should allow us to answer queries moreanalytically, rather than by reading enormous amounts of raw data. Also,processing more queries should continuously enhance our knowledge of theunderlying distribution, and hence lead to increasingly faster response timesfor future queries.

TranspoGene containsinformation regarding specific type and family of the TEs, genomic and mRNAlocation, sequence, supporting transcript accession and alignment to the TEconsensus sequence. The database also contains host gene specific data: genename, genomic location, Swiss-Prot and RefSeq accessions, diseases associatedwith the gene and splicing pattern.

For those who perform bibliometric analyses andcomparisons of countries or institutions, the existence of these two majordatabases raises the important question of the comparability and stability ofstatistics obtained from different data sources. This paper uses macro-levelbibliometric indicators to compare results obtained from the WoS and Scopus. Itshows that the correlations between the measures obtained with both databasesfor the number of papers and the number of citations received by countries, aswell as for their ranks, are extremely high (R2 > .99). There is also a veryhigh correlation when countries papers are broken down by field.

Other reactions possessmultiple entries that are each valid in a different temperature regime, buthave no smooth transition when switching from one to another. Numerically, thisintroduces many difficulties.We present corrected parametrizations for thesesets of reactions in the UDFA06 database.  Methods. From the tabulated parametrization in UDFA, we created artificialdata points and used a Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm to find a set of improvedfit parameters without divergent behavior for low temperatures. For reactionswith multiple entries in the database that each possess a different temperatureregime, we present one joint parametrization that is designed to be valid overthe whole cumulative temperature range of all individual reactions.

This is obtained by preprocessing SQL statements atcompile time and translating them into type-safe database access operations. Asa consequence, the type checker of the Curry system can spot type errors in SQLstatements at compile time. To generate appropriately typed access operations,the preprocessor uses an entity-relationship (ER) model describing thestructure of the relational data.

We derive the SED of the reference model withour code MC3D at 78 logarithmically distributed wavelengths in the range[0.3um, 1.3mm] and use this setup to simulate SEDs for the database and SA. Ourresult shows directly the applicability of SA in the field of SED modeling,since the algorithm regularly finds better solutions to the optimizationproblem than a pre-calculated database. As both methods have advantages andshortcomings, a hybrid approach is preferable. While the database provides anapproximate fit and overall probability distributions for all parametersdeduced using Bayesian analysis, SA can be used to improve upon the resultsreturned by the model grid.'),

The majority of associationsfound within longitudinal observational data are often non-causal and occur dueto confounding.  The focus of this paper is to investigate incorporating information fromadditional databases to complement the longitudinal observational databaseanalysis. We investigate the detection of prescription drug side effects asthis is an example of a causal relationship. In previous work a framework wasproposed for detecting side effects only using longitudinal data. In this paperwe combine a measure of association derived from mining a spontaneous reportingsystem database to previously proposed analysis that extracts domain expertisefeatures for causal analysis of a UK general practice longitudinal database.  The results show that there is a significant improvement to the performanceof detecting prescription drug side effects when the longitudinal observationdata analysis is complemented by incorporating additional drug safety sourcesinto the framework. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve(AUC) for correctly classifying a side effect when other data were consideredwas 0.967, whereas without it the AUC was 0.923 However, the results of thispaper may be biased by the evaluation and future work should overcome this bydeveloping an unbiased reference set.'),

Jakobi et al. [Phys. Rev. A, 83(2), 022301,Feb 2011] proposed a protocol for Oblivious Transfer using well known QKDtechniques to establish an Oblivious Key to solve this problem. Their solutionprovided a good degree of database and user privacy (using physical principleslike impossibility of perfectly distinguishing non-orthogonal quantum statesand the impossibility of superluminal communication) while being loss-resistantand implementable with commercial QKD devices (due to the use of SARG04).However, their Quantum Oblivious Key Distribution (QOKD) protocol requires acommunication complexity of O(N log N). Since modern databases can be extremelylarge, it is important to reduce this communication as much as possible. Inthis paper, we first suggest a modification of their protocol wherein thenumber of qubits that need to be exchanged is reduced to O(N).

Unfolding this progressionleads naturally to a two stage expand and resolve query processing strategy. Inthis strategy, we first extract the related records for a query using two novelexpansion operators, and then resolve the extracted records collectively. Wethen show how the same strategy can be adapted for query-time entity resolutionby identifying and resolving only those database references that are the mosthelpful for processing the query. We validate our approach on two largereal-world publication databases where we show the usefulness of collectiveresolution and at the same time demonstrate the need for adaptive strategiesfor query processing. We then show how the same queries can be answered inreal-time using our adaptive approach while preserving the gains of collectiveresolution.

For the Swift/BAT database it isfound that the intermediate-duration bursts might well be related to so-calledX-ray flashes (XRFs).

The classicalBohm-Vitense flavour is used in all modern MLT-based stellar modelcomputations and, despite its crude approximations, the resulting $T_{eff}$scale appears -- perhaps surprisingly -- remarkably realistic, once the mixinglength parameter is calibrated with a solar model. Model atmospherecomputations employ parameter choices different from what is used in stellarinterior modelling, raising the question of whether a single MLT flavour andmixing length value can be used to compute interiors and atmospheres of starsof all types. As a first step towards addressing this issue, we study whetherthe MLT flavour (the so-called ML2) and mixing length choice that have beenproven adequate to model white dwarf atmospheres, is able to provide, when usedin stellar models, results at least comparable to the use of the classicalBohm-Vitense flavour.

Requiring that MLT use ahydrodynamically realistic dissipation length gives a new constraint on solarmodels. While the stellar structure which results is similar to that obtainedby YREC and Garching models, the theoretical picture differs. A newquantitative connection is made between macro-turbulence, micro-turbulence, andthe convective velocity scale at the photosphere, which has finite values. Thegeometric parameter in MLT is found to correspond more reasonably with thesize of the strong downward plumes which drive convection (Stein and Nordlund1998), and thus has a physical interpretation even in MLT. Use of 3Dsimulations of both adiabatic convection and stellar atmospheres will allow thedetermination of the dissipation length and the geometric parameter (i.e., theentropy jump), with no astronomical calibration.

We developa turbulent kinetic energy equation which contains both nonlocal and timedependent terms, and is appropriate if the convective transit time is shorterthan the evolutionary time scale. The interpretation of mixing-length theory(MLT) as generally used in astrophysics is incorrect; MLT forces the mixinglength to be an imposed constant. Direct tests show that the damping associatedwith the flow is that suggested by Kolmogorov. The eddy size is approximatelythe depth of the convection zone, and this dissipation length corresponds tothe mixing length. New terms involving local heating by turbulent dissipationshould appear in the stellar evolution equations. The enthalpy flux(convective luminosity) is directly connected to the buoyant acceleration,and hence the velocity scale. MLT tends to systematically underestimate thisvelocity scale.

The parameterization is performed from acomparison of 3D CO5BOLD simulations with a grid of 1D envelopes with a varyingmixing-length parameter. In many instances, the 3D simulations are restrictedto the upper part of the convection zone. The hydrodynamical calculationssuggest, in those cases, that the entropy of the upflows does not changesignificantly from the bottom of the convection zone to regions immediatelybelow the photosphere. We rely on this asymptotic entropy value, characteristicof the deep and adiabatically stratified layers, to calibrate 1D envelopes. Thecalibration encompasses the convective hydrogen-line (DA) white dwarfs in theeffective temperature range 6000 < Teff (K) < 15,000 and the surface gravityrange 7.0 < log g < 9.0. It is established that the local MLT is unable toreproduce simultaneously the thermodynamical, flux, and dynamical properties ofthe 3D simulations. We therefore propose three different parameterizations forthese quantities. The resulting calibration can be applied to structure andenvelope calculations, in particular for pulsation, chemical diffusion, andconvective mixing studies. On the other hand, convection has no effect on thewhite dwarf cooling rates until there is a convective coupling with thedegenerate core below Teff ~ 5000 K.

In spite of the solar calibration, if MLT convection is adopted a largeuncertainty results in the shape and location of PMS tracks. 2. As long as themodel of convection is not the same in the interior and in the atmosphere theoptical depth at which we take the boundary conditions is an additionalparameter of the models. 3. The comparison between NextGen and ATLAS9 basedmodels shows that, in the Teff domain they have in common (4000--10000K), thePMS location is mainly determined by the treatment of the over-adiabaticconvection. 4.

A characteristic length (the damping length) againemerges in the simulations; it is determined by an observed balance between (1)the large-scale driving, and (2) small-scale damping.  The nature of mixing and convective boundaries is analyzed, includingdynamic, thermal and compositional effects, and compared to a simple model.  We find that  (1) braking regions (boundary layers in which mixing occurs) automaticallyappear {it beyond} the edges of convection as defined by the Schwarzschildcriterion,  (2) dynamic (non-local) terms imply a non-zero turbulent kinetic energy flux(unlike MLT),  (3) the effects of composition gradients on flow can be comparable to thermaleffects, and  (4) convective boundaries in neutrino-cooled stages differ in nature fromthose in photon-cooled stages (different Peclet numbers).  The algorithms are based upon ILES solutions to the Navier-Stokes equations,so that, unlike MLT, they do not require any calibration to astronomicalsystems in order to predict stellar properties.

We develop here the nonlinear mixing-length theory(MLT) of double-diffusive convection, in analogy to the more familiar MLT for afluid of homogeneous composition. We present approximate solutions for themixing rate in the various regimes, and show that the familiar Schwarzschildand Ledoux stability criteria are good approximations to the precise criteriain stellar interiors.  We have implemented the self-consistent computation of the temperaturegradient and turbulent mixing rate in a stellar evolution code and solved adiffusion equation to mix composition at the appropriate rate. We have evolved$15msun$ and $30msun$ stars from the zero-age main sequence to the end ofcore He-burning.

In thiswork, we examine the possibility that the apparent inefficiency of turbulentconvection is merely a shortcoming of MLT approach. We employ a model forstellar turbulent convection (Canuto, Goldman & Mazzitelli 1996) and use ananalytic approximation to the turbulent spectrum.

The model differs from the CM model inthe treatment of the rate of energy input $n_s(k)$ from the source thatgenerates the turbulence. In the present model, $n_s(k)$ is controlled by boththe {it source} and {it the turbulence} it ultimately generates, thusensuring a selfconsistent modeling of the turbulence. This improves the CMmodel in which $n_s(k)$ was taken to be equal to the growth rate of the {itlinear} unstable convective modes.  However, since the formulation of a selfconsistent treatment is far fromsimple, we were forced to use a representation of the nonlinear interactionsless complete than the one in the CM model. The ensuing equations were solvednumerically for a wide range of convective efficiencies. The results are theconvective flux, the mean square turbulent velocity, the root mean squaredturbulent pressure and the turbulent viscosity.  We implemented the model in the ATON stellar structure code and computed theevolution of a solar model. The results are generally similar to those of theCM model and thus quite different from the MLT. The present model requires asmaller overshoot into the upper radiative zone than does the CM model, inaccord with recent empirical estimates. Application to POP II stars andcomparison with the very metal-poor globular cluster M68 yields an age in therange $11div 12$ Gyr.

This paper presents theoreticalresults concerning Delta Scuti pulsating stars. The envelope of each of thesestellar structures possesses a convection zone whose development is determinedby various factors. An interacting pulsation-atmosphere physical treatment isintroduced which supplies two basic non-adiabatic physical quantities: therelative effective temperature variation and the phase lag phi^T, defined asthe angle between effective temperature variations and radial displacement.These quantities can be used to derive the phase differences and amplituderatios. Numerical values for these quantities depend critically on the alphaMLT parameter used to calculate the convection in the envelope.

The models provide detailed information about themorphology of M-type granulation and statistical properties of the convectivesurface flows. In particular, we determined the efficiency of the convectiveenergy transport, and the efficiency of mixing by convective overshoot. Theconvective transport efficiency was expressed in terms of an equivalentmixing-length parameter alpha in the formulation of mixing-length theory (MLT)given by Mihalas (1978). Alpha amounts to values around 2 for matching theentropy of the deep, adiabatically stratified regions of the convectiveenvelope, and lies between 2.5 and 3.0 for matching the thermal structure ofthe deep photosphere. For current spectral analysis of PMS objects this impliesthat MLT models based on alpha=2.0 overestimate the effective temperature by100 K and surface gravities by 0.25 dex. The average thermal structure of theformally convectively stable layers is little affected by convective overshootand wave heating, i.e., stays close to radiative equilibrium conditions.

Simulations in 2D aresignificantly different from 3D, both in terms of flow morphology and velocityamplitude. Convective mixing regions are better predicted using a [dynamicboundary condition] based on the bulk Richardson number than by purely local,static criteria like Schwarzschild or Ledoux. MLT gives a good description ofthe velocity scale and temperature gradient for a mixing length of $sim 1.1H_p$ for shell convection, however there are other important effects that itdoes not capture near boundaries. Convective overshooting is best describedas an elastic response by the convective boundary, rather than ballisticpenetration of the stable layers by turbulent eddies. We find that the rate atwhich material entrainment proceeds at the boundaries is consistent withanalogous laboratory experiments as well as simulation and observation ofterrestrial atmospheric mixing. In particular, the normalized entrainment rateE=$u_E/sigma_H$, is well described by a power law dependence on the bulkRichardson number $Ri_B = Delta b L/sigma_H^2$ for the conditions studied,$20lesssim Ri_B lesssim 420$.

The TCM has been applied successfully inthe whole convective envelopes including the convective unstable zone and theovershooting regions. We find that the convective motions become stronger andstronger when the stellar models are located upper and upper along the Hayashiline. In the convective unstable zone, we find that the turbulent correlationsare proportional to functions of a common factor $(\nabla-\nabla_{ad})ar{T}$,which explains similar distributions of those correlations. For the TCM we findthat if the obtained stellar structure of temperature is close to that of theMLT, the convective motion will be at a much larger velocity and thus moreviolent. However, if the turbulent velocity is adjusted to close to that of theMLT, the superadiabatic convection zone is much more extended inward and alower effective temperature of the stellar model will be obtained. For theovershooting distance we find that the e-folding lengths of the turbulentkinetic energy k in both the top and bottom overshooting regions decrease asthe stellar model is located up along the Hayashi line, but both the extents ofthe decrease are not obvious.

These downdrafts transport heatnonlocally, a phenomenon referred to as entropy rain. Moreover, the Deardorffterm can cause upward enthalpy transport even in a weakly Schwarzschild-stablystratified layer. In that case, no giant cell convection would be excited. Thisis interest in view of recent observations, which could be explained if thedominant flow structures were of small scale even at larger depths. To studythis possibility, three distinct flow structures are examined: one in whichconvective structures have similar size and mutual separation at all depths,one in which the separation increases with depth, but their size is stillunchanged, and one in which both size and separation increase with depth, whichis the standard flow structure.

Quantitatively similar behavior occurs in the model of a convective roll(cell) of Lorenz (1963), which is known to have a strange attractor that givesrise to chaotic fluctuations in time of velocity and, as we show, luminosity.Study of simulations suggests that the behavior of a Lorenz convective roll mayresemble that of a cell in convective flow. We examine some implications ofthis simplest approximation, and suggest paths for improvement.  Using the Lorenz model as representative of a convective cell, amultiple-cell model of a convective layer gives total luminosity fluctuationswhich are suggestive of irregular variables (red giants and supergiants(Schwarzschild 1975)), and of the long secondary period feature in semi-regularAGB variables (Stothers 2010, Wood, Olivier and Kawaler 2004). Thistau-mechanism is a new source for stellar variability, which is inherentlynon-linear (unseen in linear stability analysis), and one closely related tointermittency in turbulence. It was already implicit in the 3D globalsimulations of Woodward, Porter and Jacobs (2003). This fluctuating behavior isseen in extended 2D simulations of CNeOSi burning shells (Arnett and Meakin2011b), and may cause instability which leads to eruptions in progenitors ofcore collapse supernovae PRIOR to collapse.'),
(376, 'Experimental data from a constellation of five NOAA POES satellites were usedfor studying the penetration of solar energetic particles (SEP) to highlatitudes during long-lasting SEP events on December 5 to 15, 2006. Wedetermined cutoff latitudes for electrons with energies >100 keV and > 300 keV,and protons with energies from 240 keV to >140 MeV. The large number ofsatellites allowed us to derive snap shots of the cutoff boundaries with 1-hourtime resolution. The boundaries were fitted well by ellipses. Based on theelliptical approach, we developed a model of cutoff latitudes for protons andelectrons in the northern and southern hemispheres. The cutoff latitude isrepresented as a function of rigidity, R, of particles, MLT, geomagneticindices: Dst, Kp, AE, and dipole tilt angle PS. The model predicts tailward andduskward shifting of the cutoff boundaries in relation to intensification ofthe cross-tail current, field-aligned currents, and symmetrical andasymmetrical parts of the ring current. The model was applied for prediction ofa polar cap absorption (PCA) effects observed at high latitudes by CADI networkof ionosondes. It was found that the PCA effects are related mainly to intensefluxes of >2.5 MeV protons and >100 keV electrons, which contribute mostly tothe ionization of ionospheric D-layer at altitudes of ~75 to 85 km. Thisfinding was confirmed independently by FORMOSAT-3/COSMIC observations of theSEP-associated enhancements of electron content at altitudes of ~80 km.Supplement : a program-code of the PCap-model'),
(377, 'We present the analysis of 71 hours of high quality time-series CCDphotometry of the helium atmosphere pulsating white dwarf (DBV) EC 04207-4748obtained using the facilities at Mt John University Observatory in New Zealand.The photometric data set consists of four week-long observing sessions coveringthe period March to November 2011. A Fourier analysis of the lightcurvesyielded clear evidence of four independent eigenmodes in the star with thedominant mode having a period of 447 s. The lightcurve variations exhibitdistinct nonsinusoidal shapes, which results in significant harmonics of thedominant frequency appearing in the Fourier transforms. These observedvariations are interpreted in terms of nonlinear contributions from the energyflux transmission through the subsurface convection zone in the star. Ourmodelling of this mechanism, using the methods first introduced by Montgomery(2005), yields a time-averaged convective response time of tau_0 ~ 150 s forthe star, and this is shown to be broadly consistent with a MLT/alpha parametervalue between 0.8 and 1.2. It is argued that for the DBV pulsators the measuredvalue of tau_0 is a better estimate of the relative stellar surfacetemperatures than those obtained via spectroscopic techniques.'),
(378, 'Several searches have found evidence of $^{60}$Fe deposition, presumably froma near-Earth supernova (SN), with concentrations that vary in differentlocations on Earth. This paper examines various influences on the path ofinterstellar dust carrying $^{60}$Fe from a SN through the heliosphere, withthe aim of estimating the final global distribution on the ocean floor. Westudy the influences of magnetic fields, angle of arrival, wind and oceancycling of SN material on the concentrations at different locations. We findthat the passage of SN material through the mesosphere/lower thermosphere (MLT)is the greatest influence on the final global distribution, with ocean cyclingcausing lesser alteration as the SN material sinks to the ocean floor. SNdistance estimates in previous works that assumed a uniform distribution are agood approximation. Including the effects on surface distributions, we estimatea distance of $46^{+10}_{-6}$ pc for a $8-10  M_{odot}$ SN progenitor. Thisis consistent with a SN occurring within the Tuc-Hor stellar group $sim$2.8Myr ago with SN material arriving on Earth $sim$2.2 Myr ago. We note that theSN dust retains directional information to within $1^{circ}$ through itsarrival in the inner Solar System, so that SN debris deposition on inert bodiessuch as the Moon will be anisotropic, and thus could in principle be used toinfer directional information. In particular, we predict that existing lunarsamples should show measurable $^{60}$Fe differences.'),
(379, 'We present three eastward-expanding auroral surge (EEAS) events that wereobserved intermittently at intervals of about 15 min in the post-midnightsector (01:55-02:40 MLT) by all-sky imagers and magnetometers in northernEurope. It was deduced that each surge occurred just after each onset of amultiple-onset substorm, which was small-scale and did not clearly expandwestward, because they were observed almost simultaneously with Pi 2 pulsationsat the magnetic equator and magnetic bay variations at middle-to-high latitudesassociated with the DP-1 current system. The EEASs showed similar properties toomega bands or torches reported in previous studies, such as recurrenceintervals of about 15 min, concurrence with magnetic pulsations with amplitudesof several tens of nanotesla, horizontal scales of 300-400 km, and occurrenceof a pulsating aurora in a diffuse aurora after the passage of the EEASs.Furthermore, the EEASs showed similar temporal evolution to the omega bands,during which eastward-propagating auroral streamers occurred simultaneously inthe poleward region, followed by the formation of north-south-aligned auroras,which eventually connected with the EEASs. Thus, we speculate that EEASs may berelated to the generation process of omega bands. (Continued)'),
(380, 'The MEPED instruments on board the NOAA POES andMetOp satellites have beencontinuously measuring energetic particles in the magnetosphere since 1978.However, degradation of the proton detectors over time leads to an increase inthe energy thresholds of the instrument and imposes great challenges to studiesof long-term variability in the near-Earth space environment as well as ageneral quantification of the proton fluxes. By comparing monthly meanaccumulated integral flux from a new and an old satellite at the same magneticlocal time (MLT) and time period, we estimate the change in energy thresholds.The first 12 monthly energy spectra of the new satellite are used as areference, and the derived monthly correction factors over a year for an oldsatellite show a small spread, indicating a robust calibration procedure. Themethod enables us to determine for the first time the correction factors alsofor the highest-energy channels of the proton detector. In addition, we makeuse of the newest satellite in orbit (MetOp-01) to find correction factors for2013 for the NOAA 17 and MetOp-02 satellites. Without taking into account thelevel of degradation, the proton data from one satellite cannot be usedquantitatively for more than 2 to 3 years after launch. As the electrondetectors are vulnerable to contamination from energetic protons, the correctedproton measurements will be of value for electron flux measurements too. Thus,the correction factors ensure the correctness of both the proton and electronmeasurements.'),
(381, 'We present evolutionary calculations aimed at describing the born-againscenario for post-AGB remnant stars of 0.5842 and 0.5885 msun. Results arebased on a detailed treatment of the physical processes responsible for thechemical abundance changes. We considered two theories of convection: thestandard mixing length theory (MLT) and the double-diffusive GNA convectiondeveloped by Grossman et al. The latter accounts for the effect of the chemicalgradient ($\nablamu$) in the mixing processes and in the transport of energy.We also explore the dependence of the born-again evolution on some physicalhypothesis, such as the effect of the existence of non-zero chemical gradients,the prescription for the velocity of the convective elements and the size ofthe overshooting zones. Attention is given to the behavior of the born-againtimes and to the chemical evolution during the ingestion of protons. We findthat in our calculations born again times are dependent on time resolution. Inparticular when the minimum allowed time step is below $5 	imes 10^{-5}$ yr weobtain, with the standard mixing length theory, born again times of 5-10 yr.This is true without altering the prescription for the efficiency of convectivemixing during the proton ingestion. On the other hand we find that theinclusion of the chemical gradients in the calculation of the mixing velocitytend to increase the born again times by about a factor of two. In addition wefind that proton ingestion can be seriously altered if the occurrence ofovershooting is modified by the $\nablamu$-barrier at the H-He interface,strongly altering born again times.'),
(382, 'We present a low-resolution (R = 90), 5.5-38 micron spectral sequence of asample of M, L, and T dwarfs obtained with the Infrared Spectrograph (IRS)onboard the Spitzer Space Telescope. The spectra exhibit prominent absorptionbands of H_2O at 6.27 microns, CH_4 at 7.65 microns, and NH_3 at 10.5 micronsand are relatively featureless at lambda > 15 microns. Three spectral indicesthat measure the strengths of these bands are presented; H_2O absorptionfeatures are present throughout the MLT sequence while the CH_4 and NH_3 bandsfirst appear at roughly the L/T transition. Although the spectra are, ingeneral, qualitatively well matched by synthetic spectra that include theformation of spatially homogeneous silicate and iron condensate clouds, thespectra of the mid-type L dwarfs show an unexpected flattening from roughly 9to 11 microns. We hypothesize that this may be a result of a population ofsmall silicate grains that are not predicted in the cloud models. The spectrumof the peculiar T6 dwarf 2MASS J0937+2931 is suppressed from 5.5-7.5 micronsrelative to typical T6 dwarfs and may be a consequence of its mildlymetal-poor/high surface gravity atmosphere. Finally, we compute bolometricluminosities of a subsample of the M, L, and T dwarfs by combining the IRSspectra with previously published 0.6-4.1 micron spectra and find goodagreement with the values of Golimowski et al. who use L- and M-bandphotometry and to account for the flux emitted at lambda > 2.5 microns.'),
(383, 'We have constructed a grid of about 10,000 spherically symmetric andplane-parallel models with the MARCS program, and make it available for publicuse. Parameter ranges are: Teff=2500 to 8000 K, log g =log(GM/R2)= -1 to 5(cgs) with various masses and radii, [Me/H]=-5 to +1, with [Alpha/Fe] = 0.0 and0.4 and different choices of C and N abundances to also represent stars oftypes R, S and N, and with microturbulence parameters from 1 to 5 km/s. We alsolist fluxes in approximately 108,000 wavelength points. Underlying assumptionsin addition to 1D stratification include hydrostatic equilibrium, MLTconvection and LTE. A number of general properties of the models are discussed,in relation to the effects of changing blanketing and sphericity.  Models are compared with other available grids and excellent agreement isfound with plane-parallel models of Castelli and Kurucz within the overlappingparameter range. Although there are departures from the spherically symmetricNextGen models, the agreement with more recent PHOENIX models is gratifying.The models of the grid show regularities, but some interesting departures fromgeneral patterns occur for the coolest models due to the molecular opacities.We have tested rules of thumb concerning effects of blanketing and sphericityand found them to often be astonishingly accurate. Some interesting newphenomena have been discovered, such as the intricate coupling betweenblanketing and sphericity, and the strong effects of carbon enhancement onmetal-poor models. We give further details of models and comparisons withobservations in subsequent papers.'),
(384, 'The envelopes of stars near the Eddington limit are prone to variousinstabilities. A high Eddington factor in connection with the Fe opacity peakleads to convective instability, and a corresponding envelope inflation mayinduce pulsational instability. Here, we investigate the occurrence andconsequences of both instabilities in models of Wolf-Rayet stars. We determinethe convective velocities in the sub-surface convective zones to estimate theamplitude of the turbulent velocity at the base of the wind that potentiallyleads to the formation of small-scale wind structures, as observed in severalWR stars. We also investigate the effect of mass loss on the pulsations of ourmodels. We approximated solar metallicity WR stars by models of mass-losinghelium stars, and we characterized the properties of convection in the envelopeadopting the standard MLT. Our results show the occurrence of sub-surfaceconvective regions in all studied models. Small surface velocity amplitudes arepredicted for models with masses below 10Msun. For models with M>10Msun, thesurface velocity amplitudes are of the order of 10km/s. Moreover we find theoccurrence of pulsations for stars in the mass range 9-14Msun, while mass lossappears to stabilize the more massive WR stars. We confront our results withobservationally derived line variabilities of 17 WN stars. The data suggestvariability to occur for stars above 10Msun, which is increasing linearly withmass above this value, in agreement with our results. We further find some ofour models to be unstable to radial pulsations, and predict local magneticfields of the order of hundreds of Gauss in WR stars more massive than 10Msun.Our study relates the surface velocity fluctuations induced by sub-surfaceconvection to the formation of clumping in the inner part of the wind. Fromthis mechanism, we expect a stronger variability in more massive WR stars.');
